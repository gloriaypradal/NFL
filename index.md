## NFL Defense Scheme Predictive Analitics

Purpose -- How great would it be to be able to effectively defend the offense before the play even starts. Realistically speaking that would require a lot of last second decision making based on the offensive formation.  The implementation of data science could enhance the process!
The proposed project will give the defensive coordinators an advantage by using data science modeling techniques to provide the defensive coordinators insights into which of their schemes will best defend against their opponent’s offense.
Model Concept: 
Create a model that can effectively determine the best defensive formation based on the offensive formation. 


### The Project

This Project was work on a team with two of my classmates: Mohamad Quteifan and Kayla Thompson


```markdown
The data consists of all passing plays. One thing that caused some confusion is “Unknown play type” but after conducting some EDA it was determined that the plays were all passing plays “unknown” just meant the play ended in a sack. 
The good thing about the data is that we did not have to conduct any data imputing -- there were a limited number of missing values and most the missing values were from features that are not going to be used.
